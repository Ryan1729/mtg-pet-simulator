# MTG Pet Simulator

This is a project (in whatever state of completion you find it) to simulate many games of Magic the Gathering against the pets described in the "Playing Your Pet" article or similar things.

This is planned to start with just the Goldfish, and the cards for a particular deck of mine, but may end up getting expanded in the future.

An, (as far as I know) unique feature is that this program will have the option to check every single posible draw for the given deck, and I will attept to make this complete in a reasonable amount of time.

If it seems like it cannot (reasonably) be done in a reasonable aount of time, then I plan to make it resumable so that over a longer-than-reasonable time, one can still get the answer of how many draws of a given deck win/lose against a given pet, and on what turn.
